# 👩🏻‍💻 Christine Egan
## Data Scientist | Data Engineer | Natural Language Processing Engineer

🔭 I’m currently working on refining my flatiron-capstone, a Facebook political ad classification project in Python. I employ natural language processing techniques  using SpaCy and NLTK to process the messages in 10,000 political ads. I also used SpaCy and Vader to engineer new features like sentiment polarity and word embeddings.  Finally, I used SciKit-Learn to deploy three different machine learning models and compared the results.

📓 I’m currently learning OOP, SQL and Docker.

 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on NLP projects.

 🤔 I’m looking for help with enriching my knowledge of statistics and SQL. 

 💬 Ask me about coding in Python — it’s one of my favorite topics. 

 ⚡ Fun fact: I have a  🎓 Bachelor of Arts in Linguistics and Philosophy from Stony Brook University.
